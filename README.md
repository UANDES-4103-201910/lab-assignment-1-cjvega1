Base project for lab assignment 1

3) I can observe that the code is html which is the basic code for http, the structure for this page in macro is a head and a body
inside the head it can be seen some links, icons and the title of the page. 
Inside the body it can be seen the tipe of script, which in this case is java and the center, the center includes the table who contains
all the links to the diferent news (the title of the news and the link), inside this we can see that the structure is the same but this
time the head and the body are far more complex than the principal page.
The tags that i can find are:
- htm>: defines that this is a html document
- head: defines info of the document
- meta: defines metadata for the document
- link: defines a relation to another document, mostly used for style
- body: defines documentÂ´s body
- tbody: groups the body content in a table
- center: defines centered text
- script: defines a client-side script
- table: defines a table
- tr: defines a row in the table
- td: defines a cell in the table
- a: defines hyperlink
- span: defines a selection in a document
- img: defines an image
  
  
4) There are 6 items donwloaded in the cloud icon, these are:
- the "news.css" is a documet in charge of the style and design of the page
- "hn.js" is a code in charge of the functions, events and interactions
- (index) is the main program of the page
- "grayarrow.gif" is an image or gif present in the page
- "s.gif" is an image or gif present in the page
- "y18.gif" is an image or gif present in the page


5) the "xhr request" is a method used to obtain info and data form a page whithout a complete reload of that page, that means that the
web browser only needs to recharge a part of the data. This request is used when you reload the page and i think that this only aplies for 
pages with a lot of info.
